# JavaScript Password Generator
Starter code to create an application that will enable employees the ability to generate random passwords based on preselected criteria powered by JavaScript code.

The generator allows the user the options to include uppercase, lowercase, numeric characters, and special character, as well as choose the length of their password anywhere between 8-128 characters.

If the user selects a length value less than 8 or greater than 128, the generator will prompt with an message stating "Error: length is not within 8-128 characters". 

If the user does not select any of the following: uppercase, lowercase, numeric or special characters, they will also be prompted with an error message.
